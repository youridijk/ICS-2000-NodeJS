# Klik Aan Klik Uit ICS-2000 docs

In this directory, you will find documentation for the ICS-2000. This documentation is mainly based on the code
of [Stijn-Jacobs ICS2000-Python library](https://github.com/Stijn-Jacobs/ICS2000-Python), partially on the code
of [bp-ouhaha's fork of the ICS2000-Python library](https://github.com/bp-ouhaha/ICS2000-Python)
and partially on my own research.
